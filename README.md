## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Module
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework


### What I learned
This is the first project I made using TypeScript, which is hard but useful (and sometimes annoying). It helps me be more aware of what I really want the code to do. One trick that is worth noting is that if you have ever encountered the error ```Element implicitly has an 'any' type because expression of type 'string' can't be used to index type â€¦``` when trying to access an object property using some string index, the easy fix would be add ```[key:string]: any``` to the objectâ€™s interface.
This project helps me reinforce my knowledge on NextJS. One interesting thing I learned is that you cannot add class to a â€˜next/imageâ€™ element. There are two suggestions on Stack Overflow about how to fix it. The first one is to use â€˜next/future/image` but it seems not working. The second one is to transform a svg image to React element  and then change its properties directly in javascript. It works very well in my situation.




```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
